# Datadog-Scripts

This repo contains any scripts that i've whipped together to help with datadog integrations


### alert-status.sh
This script queries your monitors and prints a simple status output.
As a note - if you have a multi-check alert configured, this will only print the overall status of the check and not the individual status.
